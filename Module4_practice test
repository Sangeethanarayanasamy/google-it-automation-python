Question 2
Fill in the blank using a list comprehension. With the given list of "filenames", this code should rename all files with the extension .hpp to the extension .h. The code function should then generate a new list called "new_filenames" that contains the filenames with the new extension.

You are given a list of filenames like this:

filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]

Output the list with all of the ".hpp" files renamed to end with ".h". Leave the other filenames alone. For this question, you must use list comprehension to create the list. 


filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate new_filenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
new_filenames =[filename[:-3]+"h" if filename.endswith("hpp") else filename for filename in filenames]  # Start your code here


print(new_filenames) 
# Should print ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
Ans:
['program.c', 'stdio.h', 'sample.h', 'a.out', 'math.h', 'hpp.out']
